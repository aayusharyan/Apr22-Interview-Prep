### Styled Components
- It's an additional package that we install to create styled components.
- This package, makes giving CSS to any component easy.

-> You have scoping. Each component has it's own CSS.
-> You can use props. That means, theme switching, or re-rendering on change of a state is very easy.
-> No need of inline styling. CSS is separate and JS is separate.
-> Use pseudo classes and pseudo elements better with styled in a single line.
-> CSS is more clean because we don't have to write in terms of JS.
